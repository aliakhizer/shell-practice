# Shell Programming Practice

Welcome to my Shell Programming Practice repository! In this repository, I have completed six tasks to improve  my shell scripting skills. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each task along with the scripts I created.

## Task 1: File Search Script
I created a script that allows users to search for a file within a specified folder. The script takes a folder path and a file name as input and returns the file if found.

```bash ./script1/scrip1.sh```

## Task 2: Deployment Pipeline
I developed a utility script to create three files in a folder then copy files from folder I created to another folder and swap both folder names.

```bash ./script2/script2.sh```

## Task 3: Parse Local IP Address
Using the ifconfig command, I extracted the local IP address (192.168.xxx.xxx) and displayed it using the script.

```bash ./script3/script3.sh```

## Task 4: Modify PS1 Prompt
I modified my PS1 prompt to give it a custom Timestamp look. 

```bash ./script4/script4.sh```

## Task 5: Box Printing Script
I created a script that prints a string inside a box. The script takes a string as input and prints it inside a box.

```bash ./script5/script5.sh "THIS STRING"```

## Task 6: Pass Arguments through Flags
I created a script that prints a string inside a box. The script takes a string as input and prints it inside a box.

```bash ./script6/script6.sh -s "THIS STRING" -c "+"```
